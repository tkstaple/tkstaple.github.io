                <h1>Biomotion Visibility Aids for Bicyclists:<br> A 3D Eye-tracking Analysis</h1>
                <p>The purpose of this research is to investigate the effectiveness of biomotion visibility aids with other configurations for nighttime bicyclists via 3D eye-tracking technology through a blind between-subjects experiment. This research has the potential to benefit both drivers and nighttime bicyclists through a better understanding of how biomotion can increase visibility, and also to further inform clothing designers on how to incorporate biomotion to increase bicyclist visibility and safety.

                <h1>Background</h1>
                <p>Biological motion, or biomotion, is the perceptual phenomenon in which highlighting the major joints of the body significantly increases recognition of the human form. By taking advantage of biomotion, clothing garments can increase visibility of bicyclists. A total of forty participants were randomly assigned one of four visibility aid conditions in the experiment: <strong>biomotion</strong> (retroreflective knee and ankle bands), non-biomotion (retroreflective vest configuration), pseudo-biomotion (vertical retroreflective stripes on the back of the legs), and control (all-black clothing). Gaze fixations were measured with a 3D eye-tracking system and coordinate data for each condition were analyzed via one-way ANOVA and Tukeyâ€™s post-hoc analyses, with supplementary heatmaps.</p>
