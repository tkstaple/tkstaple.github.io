            <div class="p2container">
                <p>The purpose of this research is to investigate the effectiveness of biomotion visibility aids with other configurations for nighttime bicyclists via 3D eye-tracking technology through a blind between-subjects experiment. This research has the potential to benefit both drivers and nighttime bicyclists through a better understanding of how biomotion can increase visibility, and also to further inform clothing designers on how to incorporate biomotion to increase bicyclist visibility and safety.

                <div class="two-thirds">
                    <p>Biological motion, or biomotion, is the perceptual phenomenon in which highlighting the major joints of the body significantly increases recognition of the human form. By taking advantage of biomotion, clothing garments can increase visibility of bicyclists. In the existing visibility aid design literature, a common experimental design is to assign an explicit recognition task, such as pressing a button when a participant recognizes a bicyclist. Explicit recognition tasks pose a potential bias in normal driving state and attention. There is a lack of <b>blind</b> studies on biomotion visibility aids. </p>

                    <p>A total of forty participants were randomly assigned one of four visibility aid conditions in the experiment: <b>biomotion</b> (retroreflective knee and ankle bands), <b>non-biomotion</b> (retroreflective vest configuration), <b>pseudo-biomotion</b> (vertical retroreflective stripes on the back of the legs), and <b>control</b> (all-black clothing). Gaze fixations were measured with a 3D eye-tracking system and coordinate data for each condition were analyzed via one-way ANOVA and Tukeyâ€™s post-hoc analyses, with supplementary heatmaps. The real purpose of the research was blinded to participants in order to avoid any biases stemming from an explicit observation or recognition tasks. <br><br>The eye-tracking technology used in the study was the Pupil Pro 3D eye-tracking glasses from <a href="https://pupil-labs.com/">Pupil Labs</a>. After the experiment, participants took a questionnaire addressing their qualitative assessment of the visibility aid designs.</p>

                    <p>Although this research addresses what the most effective design / configuration of reflective visibility aids are, in order to make a difference in the safety of bicyclists at night, adoptibility of visibility aids needs to be researched. Based on previous research as well as the qualitative questionnaire, aesthetics, lifestyle, price, and convenience all factor in to the adoptibility of visibiliy aids. In designing visibility aids, it is important for companies and individuals to keep these aspects in mind.</p>
